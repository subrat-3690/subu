HTML started by Tim Berner's LEE(WWW founder) in 1989-1992.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. current version of HTML is HTML5.

In HTML , everything is defined by tags. tags represent context and there are two types. open and close
<tagname> -- open tag
</tagname> -- closed tag

whole html code will be between <html> and </html>
html contains two child tags.., head and body

In HTML,comments are written as <!--         comment         --->
headings:
headings are used to specify important terms.There six headings available in HTML. all are bold and differed by size.
eg:h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6
---->Per one page,one h1 is recommanded for SEO Purpose

paragraphs: paragraphs are by default font-size:16px  and it represents normal paragraphs using p tag
---> lorem,lorem20 are used to generate dummy text of 20 words

Anchor tag: 'a' tag is used to link one web page to another / to navigate from one web page to another

href take the value from user and respond the result to anchor tag

target="_blank" is used open the link in new tab

title="" represents title of tag/element as a popover
=====================================================

Forms are used to collect user's data
Forms have two attributes , action and method
action is the file/ path to which we submit details
method ---> how data is transferred

data is entered through input elements. 
input element is a self closing inline element and it uses four attributes
i. type -- it defines type of the input element
ii. name - name is the variable which holds value
iii. value -- it holds actual value
iv. placeholder - dummy text placed until actual value enters
v. id - id is used to uniquely identify the input type

we can also use labels to label every input elements.
labels uses for attribute which connects to id attribute in input element

different types of inputs:
text, email, password,date,time,datetime-local, url,file, image,hidden,color,week,month,range,search,tel,number

Radio : Radio button/inputs are used when we need to select single choice
we can use type radio with valid labels but names of similar radios should be same

Checkbox : Checkboxes ares used when we need to select multiple choices
we can use type checkbox with valid labels  but names of similar checkboxes should be same

Select: select is used to create drop downs which can select single or multiple options
  In select , we options for each option


TextArea
submit
Reset

form-validation:
we can validate forms using form-validation
readonly: we can't overwrite readonly input types
disabled: we can make inputs disabled based on choice
required : we can make some inputs required
maxlength : to specify maximum no.of characters
minlength: to specify minimum no.of characters
max/min : to specify maximum / minimum value
pattern: uses a regular expression to specify certail email/password patterns
========================================================

Tags vs Elements:
Tags are either open or close 
eg: <h1>-- h1 open tag,</h1>-- close tag
<h1>abcd</h1>  -----> h1 element
element ===> open tag+content+close

self-closing tags or empty elements or void elements will not have any closing tag
<br> or <br/>
<img src=" " alt=" " />

block elements vs inline elements:

Block elements doesn't allows the other elements beside them
i. Inline elements allows the other elements beside them -a, img, b, strong
ii. block elements also cover height/width and inline doesn't-p, lists, table, semantic element
   eg: popular/general block element is --- div
   popular/general inline element is --- span

  /* make an image and anchor tag and make them come in different lines using block/inline general elements */
===============================

eg: todo list, grocery list, contact list,marks list,country list,attandence list

lists are actually divided as three types
1. ordered list
2. unordered list
3. definition list
========================================

Tables are used to represent data in simple way using rows and columns
horizontal line of data is called row
Vertical line of data is called column

table in Html comprises <table> tag
tr --->table row
th or td ---> table head or table data
caption ---> heading / caption of the table
rowspan -- > combine rows
colspan --> combine columns
=======================================

semantic elements are for SEO and readability purposes. it won't create any difference in the UI. It used to make search engine understands our code easily.
popular semantic elements are header,main,footer,section,article,aside,nav etc..,

Classes and ID: classes and Id's are used to identify the elements but two elements might have same classname or one element might have two class names. Ids are always unique and only one for an element
