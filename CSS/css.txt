1.  inline CSS : we can assign Styling to certain elements in their own line called inline CSS
<p Style = "background-color:black;>">


<Style>
     p{color:red;}
</Style>
3. extranal CSS : we can write CSS as a separate file andandcinnect them the link
<link

Basic Selectors:
There are so many Selectors, basic are tagname, id, class name 

tagname: we can directly, it applies to all elements with that tagname.

classname : classname are identified by classnames and their properties applies to all the elements with specific class name

idname : id's are identified by # and properties applies only element with that id  
id> class> tagname
inline> internal> extranal

colors represents visual connection to the user
colors can be assigned by name, hexcode, rgb(red, green, blue)-0 to 255, rgba(red,green,blue,alpha-0.0 to 
1.0),hsl(hue - angle, saturation, lightness)hsal(hue,saturation, lightness, alpha)
gradient-mixed of color
lineatr-gradient(color1,color2),lineatr-gradient(to right,color1,color2)
radial-gradient(color1,color2)-show transformation from color1 to color2 starting from center and circle.

Fonts: Fonts represents your brand and it helps you to connect your audience well
there are 5 types of Fonts
1.serif: every letter in serif font has some stocke at the end. EX-> serif
2.san-serif: sans means no. sans serif font will not have any stock at the end. EX->Arial
3.monospace: every letter will have same hight. EX-> roboto
4.cursive: every letter have a Style/shape.
5.fantasy: any morden font other then avobe 4 is fantasy.

we can assign Fonts to css using google fonts.

How to include google font into css ?
google font-->Selct a font-->get font-->get embeded code-->import copy import and paste it at the top of the css also add font-family to representively element.
we can arjust fonts by font-size,font-style,font-weight.

we can arjust text by properties.
text-align(center,left,right,justify), text-shadow(xpx,ypx,color), text decoration: xpx solid colorname;
we can assign text-decoration-style(solid,dotted,double,wave,dashed) buy you also should mention
text-decoration-line(underline/overline)
text-transformation(captalise,uppercase,lowercase)

units:  units defines a measurment in web page
px: pixels
em: em is a unit of measurment which indicate size relative to the size of the font.
rem: root enumerated value. it is x times of 16% 
%: we can give percentages of parent
vh: visual/viewpoint height
vw: visual/viewpoint width

BOX-MODEL
In Web Pages, everything is treated as box
A Box typically contains
border: borde is the outmost line of a box. we can define border width, border style(solid,double,dashed,dotted etc..,) and border color

To make corners radius, we use border-radius

padding: padding is the space between contet and border inside the box, we can define padding to left,right,bottom,top. and all at a time also

margin: margin is the space outside the border of box.

If 100px height box is given padding of 20px, then its height will increase 140px considering top 20px and bottom 20px and original height 100px, so, padding may alter height and width. this is default content-box

To avoid it, we use box-sizing:border-box
======================================================
FLOAT
Float will make elements come out of the control flow and can float anywhere in the page

float:left/start/end/right

TO remove floating values from other elements we use "clear" 
clear:left/right/both
======================================================

DISPLAY
Display is used to make elements appear in various forms
Display can be block / inline. inline elements cannot have height/width. you can use inline-block. to make an element disappear use Display none. you can even create table using Display

FlexBox: flex is used to arrange elements in row/column(any one direction) within the container
=====================================================

pCSS means Cascading Style Sheets.CSS is used for styling/Design/layout of page
How do we connect CSS to HTML?
There are three ways
1. inline CSS: we can assign styling to certain elements in their own line called inline css
<p Style="background-color:black;> Hello world </p>
2. internal CSS: we can use style as a element in the header's end
<style>
  p{ color:red; }
</style>
3. external CSS: We can write CSS as a separate file andand cinnect them though the link

<link rel="stylesheet" href="path" />


Basic Selectors:
There are so many selectors, basic are tagname,id,class name

tagname

we can tagnames directly, it applies to all elements with that tagname
classname

classnames are identified by .classnames and these properties applies to all elements with specific class name

idname

id's are identified by # and these properties applied only element with that id

id> class > tagname

inline > internal >external

Grid is used to display items in two dimensional way like rows and columns
Grid container contains items(child elements) and most of the properties belongs to container
container Properties:
  display:grid ----> it explains the container is a grid
  grid-template-columns---> how many columns we want witheach column space will be included. you can express the size by 'px','%','em','fr'
  grd-template-column:1fr 2fr; // 2 columns with 1/3 and 2/3 fractions will come
  repeat() is a function used to repeat certain size
  grid-template-columns:50px repeat(4,10px);

  grid-template-rows: we can even define rows similar to columns using grid-template-columns.

  gap: gap is the space between items,you can also use row-gap and column-gap

justify-content: it moves items through row
align-items: it moves items through column
grid-template: grid-template-rows/grid-template-columns

childern Properties:
grid-column-start: starting-column-line-number
grid-column-end: ending-column-line-number
grid-row-start: starting-row-line-number
grid-row-end: ending-row-line-number
grid-column: grid-column-start/grid-column-end;
grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;
grid-area: row-start/column-start/row-end/column-end
each item contains an order and default order is zero

Position: position is usedto keep elements at certain positions in the UI.
It contains 5 values 
 a. absolute
 b.relative
 c. fixed
 d.sticky
 e. static

static:
 By Default all Position values are static.static does not have any impact with top,left,bottom,right

 relative :
 relatives compares position from its previous position
 top ,bottom,right,left with can be use to move the elements from its previous position

 absolute: absolute is used to move the elements from the body position.

 fixed: fixed is similar ro absolute but scrolling doesnot effect fixed

 sticky: sticky is used when we want element to move initially but becomes sticky after cetain point

Pseudo elemenets: pseudo elements contains double column and they are used to select specific parts of an element

Pseudo Elements determine certains postions in the HTML elements. they are followed by ::

::first-letter: selects only first letter of selector
::first-line:selects only first line of selector
::after: selects after content of given selector
::before: selects before content of given selector
::placeholder: selects placeholder of given input

Pseudo classes: pseudo classes are used using : and they determine element based on acondition

a:link -- it defined anchor tag with a link
a:active -- it triggers when anchor tag clicked
a:visited -- it triggers when anchor link already visited
input:focus -- it triggers when input element selected
:hover -- works when you keeps mouse over it

let's understand, nth-child,nth-of-type
order of childern are p-1,div-2,p-3,div-4,p-5 ,parent class name .boxx
.boxx p:nth-child(1) means paragraph inside .boxx and child number 1, so p1 will be selected
.boxx p:nth-child(2) it selects nothing because 2nd child of boxx is not p 

we can also count from last nth-last-child
.boxx p:nth-last-child(1) seelct p5 since it is paragraph and 1st from last
.boxx p:nth-last-child(2) select nothing because 2nd child from last is not paragraph.

nth-of-type()-- selects elements based on type
.boxx p:nth-of-type(2) it selects 2nd paragraph so it is p3
we calso count this from last by nth-last-of-type
.boxx div:nth-last-of-type(1) selects div4 because it is 1st div element from last

:required  --> selects input elements which have required flag
:optional --> selects input elements which are not having required flag
:read-only  --> selects input elements which are having readonly flag
:read-write  --> selects input elements which are not having readonly flag
:disabled ---> selects input elements which are having disabled flag
:enabled --> selects input Elements which are not having disabled flag
